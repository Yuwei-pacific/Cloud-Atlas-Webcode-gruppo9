      <span>DIRECTED BY LILLY WACHOWSKI TOM TYKWER ANDY WACHOWSKI</span>
      <span>The story is a time-shifting weave of six interlinking narratives set in different eras and places. A
        time
        journey in which past, present and future merge: from the remote South Pacific of the nineteenth century
        to a
        post-apocalyptic future.Action, romance and destiny intertwine dramatically through the story showing how
        human connections overcome the barriers of time and space and where a single gesture can have an impact
        that
        spreads through the centuries.</span>
      <span>The project aims to represent and to “give life” to the imaginary thread that connects the six stories,
        making it the key and recurring element throughout the website.A thread that will create three different
        representations to explain the three crucial aspects of the film.</span>
